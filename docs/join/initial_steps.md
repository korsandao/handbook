# Initial Steps

If you want to try out being a recruit, then the process begins here.

We'll assume you have already joined our [Discord](https://discord.com/korsandao) server. If not, hop on and say hello.

First, if you don't already have one, you will need to create a Metamask wallet. You'll be using this address to vote on DAO proposals, [receive your payments](../basics/financials) and everything in between. Make sure you follow the steps carefully and triple check that you've safely saved your secret pass phrase. This is your digital identity, you should make sure you don't lose access to it.
