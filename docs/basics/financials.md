# Financials

When a project is completed and the payment is received by the DAO, everyone with logged hours in the project will be paid out from the pool. First, 10% of the total payout is transferred to the DAO treasury, and in return you get shares. We still split 100% of the money, essentially, but you receive 10% as stocks. You can, at any time, [Ragequit](./ragequit) and receive the equivalent cash amount of your shares. This ensures freedom for all of our contributors: If you need to cash out your shares, you can do it whenever you want, but also you can stay invested in the DAO; itâ€™s totally up to you.

## Payments

Our clients pay us directly with crypto, and the DAO directly transfers these funds to the contributors, so you also get paid in crypto.
