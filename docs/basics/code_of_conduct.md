# Code of Conduct

KorsanDAO is digital agency that’s worker-owned and worker-managed. We believe everyone is entitled to fruits of their labor. The DAO is structured in a way to make sure everyone, both you and the customer, is satisfied with the process to the maximum possible extent. To ensure the best experience for everyone, we have agreed upon certain core values that are crucial for the operation of the DAO. These are:

<!-- TODO please contribute-->

- **Tolerance**: We do not discriminate against or judge anyone. We expect everyone to be respectful to each other and be understanding.

- **Participation**: We want to hear everyone’s opinion. KorsanDAO is a living organism that’s constantly changing and evolving, and anyone’s contribution is highly encouraged.

- **Solidarity**: We’re all in this together. Every member of KorsanDAO has your back. You can ask anyone for help.
