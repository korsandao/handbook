# Introduction

Welcome! KorsanDAO is a guild consisted of some of the most talented people in the tech scene today. The best designers, developers and builders in the world meet here. This is the place to learn about how it all works, and how you can join the fun.

Feel free to join us on **[Discord](https://discord.com/korsandao)** to check out how it all comes together and interact with us! You don’t have to start project hunting right away, we would be very happy to answer your questions, and just hang out!

## How it works

KorsanDAO is digital agency that’s worker-owned and worker-managed. We believe everyone is entitled to fruits of their labor. The DAO is structured in a way to make sure everyone, both you and the customer, is satisfied with the process to the maximum possible extent.

If you want to try out being a Recruit, then the process begins with you either applying for a project or being assigned one. You will be expected to log your accomplishments and time spent on your assigned project.

## Financials

When a project is completed and the payment is received by the DAO, everyone with logged hours in the project will be paid out from the pool. First, 10% of the total payout is transferred to the DAO treasury, and in return you get shares. We still split 100% of the money, essentially, but you receive 10% as stocks. You can, at any time, ragequit and receive the equivalent cash amount of your shares. This ensures freedom for all of our contributors: If you need to cash out your shares, you can do it whenever you want, but also you can stay invested in the DAO; it’s totally up to you.

Our clients pay us directly with crypto, and the DAO directly transfers these funds to the contributors, so you also get paid in crypto.
